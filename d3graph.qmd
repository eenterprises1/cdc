# Interactive graph

Instructions:

-   Select one of the top 3 causes of death in the United States from the options menu.

-   The first map (i.e. the map with bubbles) will show which states have the highest death rate per 100,000 people.

-   The second map (i.e. the heatmap) will show which states have seen the most significant increase expressed as a percentage change from 1999 to 2020.

<!--
    -   If in 1999 1 person was dying from Cancer and in 2020 2 were dying because of Cancer, then the growth has been 100% in the death rate.
-->
*For example: consider choosing Alzheimer's Disease and focusing on Mississippi. The bubble map shows that Mississippi has had the highest age adjusted death rate due to Alzheimer in the United States: 58 deaths per 100,000 people. Moreover, not only it has the highest death rate, but it has seen the largest growth since 1999 in this metric: 336% increase.*
