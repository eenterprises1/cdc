# Introduction

The first aspect of our investigation focuses on identifying the current leading causes of death in the United States. This analysis is very important because it helps us determine which health problems kill the most people. Knowing these causes will help healthcare professionals and policymakers decide where to focus their efforts and resources. We want to show you the biggest health risks Americans have had in the past and still face today by looking at CDC data.

Next, we will explore how these leading causes have changed over the past decade. This historical perspective is important for noticing trends in public health, like when new health threats appear or when others are successfully lowered. By comparing past and present data, we can gain insights into the effectiveness of healthcare policies and medical advancements and identify areas that still need attention.

We will also focus on the geographical and racial disparities in these causes of death. Examining the variation in mortality causes across different states and races uncovers the inequalities in health outcomes. This part of the investigation will highlight areas where certain groups are disproportionately affected, providing a foundation for more equitable health strategies and interventions.

This analysis holds significant value for policymakers and health planners. By understanding the current trends and historical changes in mortality causes, decision-makers can better target and develop projects and policies to address these issues. This investigation aims to clarify the general trend in deaths, and where improvement can be done. For this, we will answer the following questions:

-   What are the current leading causes of death in the United States?

-   What causes seem to be more controlled? Which should be quickly tackled?

-   How have these leading causes changed over the last two decades?

-   How do these causes of death vary across different states and races?

-   Are there states that need more urgent investment in health care to control some causes of death?

-   Is there any explanation we can offer for the trends visualized?

Finally, we will link deaths for unintentional injuries to the recent opioid problem in the United States. The shocking 645,000 [opioid-related deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/opioids/data/analysis-resources.html) that happened from 1999 to 2021 show that the opioid crisis is a dangerous and growing problem that needs to be fixed. There have been two alarming waves in this crisis: a big rise in heroin overdoses starting in 2010 and a rise in deaths related to synthetic opioids, mostly from illegally made fentanyl, starting in 2013. In order to address this situation, having a clear understating is the starting point of any measure taken.
