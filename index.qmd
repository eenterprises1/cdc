The CDC is a national public health institute in the United States, dedicated to protecting health and promoting quality of life through the prevention and control of disease, injury, and disability. The CDC provides free access to a wealth of public health data and resources.

Specifically, we are going to work with the ICD-10 113 Cause List, which holds significant importance within the framework of the International Classification of Diseases. In particular, this is the 10th Revision (ICD-10), which is widely acknowledged as a universally accepted standard for the systematic classification of health conditions and the determination of causes of mortality.

Initially, the first fundamental question is to consider causes of death that have had the highest death toll from 1999 to 2020. Historically, it has become common knowledge that culprits such as cancer and heart disease are among the top causes of death in the US. The subtle step that we aim to uncover is to find out which mortality rates have remained consistent and which are rapidly rising. In particular, our data analysis hopes to identify causes of death that exhibit the highest growth in age-adjusted death rates. Thus, a crucial question we would like to answer is whether certain causes of death have increased or decreased over the last twenty years. Determining any notable outliers, particularly when examining the data state-by-state, could be quite helpful via visualizations. This task will involve a diligent examination of the percentage change in death rates across different states. We predict that some causes that made national headlines (e.g., opioid epidemic), will be visible in our findings. We are also looking forward to uncovering any surprising, and/or otherwise, unintuitive results.

The research plan depends on exploring the causes of death on a state-by-state basis and pinpointing states with disproportionately high death rates from specific causes. The data should help us highlight these regions of interest. It will be remarkably informative to see which states fare well with certain rising causes of death, and which states are exhibiting alarming rates in comparison to others. Ideally, finding any correlations that explain death rates would be illuminating.

We aim to compare and understand how different states are faring with the surge in certain causes of death, particularly those with very high rates. The goal is to uncover evident and subtle correlations that clarify these death rates. Uncovering such trends can provide policymakers and professionals (e.g., doctors, nurses, mental health professionals, representatives) with effective strategies to mitigate specific rising death tolls.
