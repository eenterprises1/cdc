    "text": "1 Introduction\n\nThe CDC is a national public health institute in the United States, dedicated to protecting health and promoting quality of life through the prevention and control of disease, injury, and disability. The CDC provides free access to a wealth of public health data and resources.\nSpecifically, we are going to work with the ICD-10 113 Cause List, which holds significant importance within the framework of the International Classification of Diseases. In particular, this is the 10th Revision (ICD-10), which is widely acknowledged as a universally accepted standard for the systematic classification of health conditions and the determination of causes of mortality.\nInitially, the first fundamental question is to consider causes of death that have had the highest death toll from 1999 to 2020. Historically, it has become common knowledge that culprits such as cancer and heart disease are among the top causes of death in the US. The subtle step that we aim to uncover is to find out which mortality rates have remained consistent and which are rapidly rising. In particular, our data analysis hopes to identify causes of death that exhibit the highest growth in age-adjusted death rates. Thus, a crucial question we would like to answer is whether certain causes of death have increased or decreased over the last twenty years. Determining any notable outliers, particularly when examining the data state-by-state, could be quite helpful via visualizations. This task will involve a diligent examination of the percentage change in death rates across different states. We predict that some causes that made national headlines (e.g., opioid epidemic), will be visible in our findings. We are also looking forward to uncovering any surprising, and/or otherwise, unintuitive results.\nThe research plan depends on exploring the causes of death on a state-by-state basis and pinpointing states with disproportionately high death rates from specific causes. The data should help us highlight these regions of interest. It will be remarkably informative to see which states fare well with certain rising causes of death, and which states are exhibiting alarming rates in comparison to others. Ideally, finding any correlations that explain death rates would be illuminating.\nUltimately, the goal is to uncover and examine subtle correlations for causes with the highest growing death rates. Uncovering such trends can provide policymakers and professionals (e.g., doctors, nurses, mental health professionals, and representatives) with effective strategies to mitigate specific rising death tolls."

    "section": "2.1 Technical description",
    "text": "2.1 Technical description\n\n2.1.1 Data collection\nWe will primarily work with data related to causes of deaths published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The data is collected by the CDC, specifically by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). This involves gathering mortality and population data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), which receives information from state and local health departments in the United States.\n\n\n2.1.2 Description of the data\n\nFormat: The data set is publicly available in CSV files on the following website: link\nFrequency: Annually updated from 1999 to 2020\nFeatures: Key features include causes of death, demographic information (race, sex, age), and geographic location (state).\nDimensions: the data set provides the following metrics:\n\nDeaths: number of deaths that occurred in a specific year for a specific race, sex, or state.\nPopulation: the total population for that specific year, race, state, etc.\nCrude Death Rate: the number of deaths divided by the total population.\nAge-Adjusted Death Rate: number of deaths adjusted by age.\n\nSpecific description: The primary data set has 37290 rows and 8 columns.\n\nIt is important to differentiate between Age-Adjusted Death Rate, Deaths, and Crude Death Rate. While the three provide information about mortality, we will mostly focus on the Age-Adjusted-Death-Rate. The Crude Rate measures the number of deaths in a given population divided by the size of that population.\n\\[\n\\small { \\text{Crude Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Deaths}}{\\text{Population}} \\times 100,000 }\n\\]\nAn increase in the number of deaths will cause a rise in the Crude Death Rate. However, this can be misleading in populations with a growing number of elderly people, who naturally have a higher likelihood of dying.\nOn the other hand, the Age-Adjusted Death Rate is a mortality rate statistically modified to eliminate the effect of different age distributions in different populations. This rate allows comparisons between populations with different age structures. A good explanation of the difference can be found here. As a formula, it can be defined as:\n\\[\n\\small { \\text{Age-Adj Death Rate} = \\sum_{i \\in \\text{Age-Groups}} (w_i \\times \\text{CrudeRate}_i)\\times 100,000 }\n\\]\nThe Age-Adjusted Death Rate is essentially a weighted average of Crude Rates for different age groups. In this metric, each additional death adds \\(w_i\\times CrudeRate_i\\) to the total, whereas in the Crude Rate, its contribution is a fixed (and higher) value of \\(1\\). For populations with a significant percentage of individuals aged 85 and above, the number of deaths is adjusted by the group’s weight. This adjustment yields a metric that facilitates the comparison of mortality rates across diverse populations.\nThere are some other data sets that we anticipate using from the CDC (e.g., data relevant to opioid dispense rates). One such data set that seems promising to answer some of the questions that we will pose later is the following link. This particular data set will need to be manually compiled as it provides data for the years 2006-2020 with 3 columns: State, Abbreviation, and Opioid Dispensing Rate per 100. The dimensions are 51x3. However, there is such a data set for each year.\n\n\n2.1.3 Importing the Data\nThe data set can be obtained from the CDC website in a CSV format. We will store the data set in the repository and import it into R using the read_csv() function. The second data set regarding opioid dispense rate is carefully imported year by year into a spreadsheet table and exported as a CSV file. Similarly, the next step is to import it into R using the read_csv() function.\n\n\n2.1.4 Data Analysis Limitations and Concerns\nOverall, the data is consistent, and the figures appear accurate, with no inherent discrepancies observed. However, it’s important to note that the CDC refrains from calculating Age-Adjusted Death Rates or Crude Death Rates when the total number of deaths is 10 or fewer, labeling these instances as ‘Unreliable’. While the actual numbers in such cases would be minimal, it’s reasonable to consider these ‘Unreliable’ values as zero for analytical purposes. We will speak more about this in the Missing value analysis section.\nWe can take a look at the first few rows of the data set:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\ncdc_dataset = read_csv(\"NCHS_Leading_Causes_of_Death_United_States_2020.csv\")\n#print(head(cdc_dataset, 10))\n\nlibrary(flextable)\nflextable(head(cdc_dataset))\n\n\n\nYear113 Cause NameCause NameStateDeathsPopulationCrude RateAge Adjusted Rate1,999Tuberculosis (A16-A19)TuberculosisAlabama164,430,1411,999Septicemia (A40-A41)SepticemiaAlabama6914,430,14115.615.61,999Viral hepatitis (B15-B19)Viral hepatitisAlabama634,430,1411.41.41,999Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease (B20-B24)Human immunodeficiency virusAlabama1774,430,1414.04.01,999Malignant neoplasms (C00-C97)CancerAlabama9,5064,430,141214.6210.91,999In situ neoplasms, benign neoplasms and neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behavior (D00-D48)In situ neoplasmsAlabama2374,430,1415.35.3"

    "text": "2.2 Research plan\nThe comprehensive data on causes of death is provided by the CDC. It includes crude and age-adjusted rates and death tolls by state, race, and year, and serves as a solid foundation for addressing our research questions.\nFirst, we will identify the top 10 highest causes of death historically over the last two decades. Then, we will address a more interesting question. We will distinguish which causes of death whose rates appear to be steady and identify the causes of death that appear to be aggressively increasing. In several instances, we anticipate that this will require us to compare time series and choose adequate metrics in order to appropriately make such comparisons. Conveniently, the age-adjusted death rate gives us an accurate glimpse while taking into account the distribution of the age groups in the US.\nA particularly interesting question that we want to answer is to identify which causes have had the fastest rate of growth in terms of age-adjusted death rate. For example, a potent question to answer would be the following: have certain causes of death been on the increase or the decrease in the last two decades? If so, are there any outliers among them, especially if we break down geographically by state? This would require careful analysis of percentage change year-by-year and analyzing the data by state. Intuitively, we are aware that certain causes of death will show up in our research (one specific example that we anticipate seeing is the deaths due to the opioid epidemic, which has been ongoing for almost a decade now). Indubitably, we expect to find surprising results.\nThe research plan depends on exploring the causes of death on a state-by-state basis. This will uncover states with disproportionately high death rates from specific causes, highlighting regions where healthcare investment may be urgently needed. It will be remarkably informative to see which states fare well with certain rising causes of death, and which states are exhibiting alarming rates in comparison to others. Ideally, finding correlations that help explain death rates would be helpful. Identifying such trends can help policymakers and professionals (e.g., doctors, nurses, mental health professionals, representatives) have a clearer understanding of the reasons behind the spikes in deaths and hopefully help guide them towards adequate solutions to mitigate the quickly rising causes of death."

    "text": "2.3 Missing value analysis\nAccording to the CDC: “Statistics representing fewer than ten persons (0-9) are suppressed. Rates are marked as “unreliable” when the death count is less than 20.” The reason they cite to to protect individual privacy and confidentiality. In theory, this ensures that data cannot be used to identify or infer information about specific individuals while maintaining ethical standards in data handling and reporting.\nFor this reason, our data set contains N/A values in Age-Adjusted Death Rate and Crude Rate for Deaths lower than 20. Moreover, there are no entries having Deaths less than 10. We can confirm this by looking at the summary() of the column Deaths being 10:\n\n\nCode\n#Searching for the minimum value registered for Deaths\nsummary(cdc_dataset$Deaths)\n\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n     10      50     203    2618     866  725192 \n\n\nThis confirms that the data set consists of entries having Deaths greater than or equal than 10.\nFinally, we can see the distribution of Deaths for NAs. The values should be higher than 10, and less than or equal to 20. Otherwise, there are inconsistencies:\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary library\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nfiltered_data &lt;- subset(cdc_dataset, is.na(`Age Adjusted Rate`))\nmax_death &lt;- max(filtered_data$Deaths, na.rm = TRUE)\n\nggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = Deaths)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, boundary = 9, fill = \"turquoise\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 9:max_death + 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Deaths where Age Adjusted Death Rate is NA\", x = \"Deaths\", y = \"Frequency\")+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the minimum value is 10 and the maximum is 19. This means that all NAs have values lower than 20 as the CDC stated.\n\n\nCode\n#Libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n#Subset\nna_count &lt;- cdc_dataset %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Cause Name`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(NA_Count = sum(is.na(`Age Adjusted Rate`))) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(NA_Count))\n\n#plot\nggplot(na_count, aes(x = NA_Count, y = reorder(`Cause Name`, NA_Count))) +\n geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"lightblue\", color = 'black') +\n  labs(title = \"Count of NAs in Age Adjusted Rate by Cause\", x = \"Number of NAs\", y = \"Cause Name\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, turning NAs into 0’s is the practical solution given they represent extremely small numbers."

The results in the bar chart are consistent with the common knowledge that suggests that heart disease and cancer are among the leading causes of death in the US. Remarkably, the deaths resulting from these 10 causes are almost 90% of the total figure of deaths.\n\n\nCode\n#Filtering cdc_dataset by the top 10 Cause Name from cdc_usa_summary\ncdc_dataset &lt;- cdc_dataset[cdc_dataset$Cause %in%  cdc_usa_summary$Cause, ]\ncdc_usa  &lt;- cdc_usa[cdc_usa$Cause %in%  cdc_usa_summary$Cause, ]\n# rm(cdc_usa_summary)\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Understanding overall trends\nAs the population grows, deaths (albeit with a lag) will also eventually grow. We would like to understand the interplay between population growth, death growth, and the changes in the death rates since 1999. The results that we aim to elucidate is to find out which mortality rates have remained consistent and which are swiftly increasing For this, we will create metrics and facet them in time series.\n\n\nCode\n#Grouping by Year and State, and summarizing the data. We can take min(Population) to keep the population of that year\ncdc_usa_grouped &lt;- cdc_usa |&gt; group_by(Year) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    Deaths = sum(Deaths),\n    Population = min(Population),\n    Crude_Rate = sum(Crude_Rate),\n    Age_Adj_Rate = sum(Age_Adj_Rate),\n    .groups = 'drop'\n  )\n\n\n#Reshaping data using pivot_longer so we can facet by metric:\ncdc_usa_long &lt;- cdc_usa_grouped |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(Deaths, Population, Crude_Rate, Age_Adj_Rate), names_to = \"Metric\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\n#Adjusting the order and names of the metrics\ncdc_usa_long$Metric &lt;- factor(cdc_usa_long$Metric, \n                                      levels = c(\"Population\", \"Crude_Rate\", \"Deaths\", \"Age_Adj_Rate\"),\n                                      labels = c(\"Population in US\", \"Crude Death Rate\", \"Deaths\", \"Age Adjusted Death Rate\"))\n\n#Creating the time series:\nggplot(cdc_usa_long, aes(x = Year, y = Value)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#FF6C22\", size = 1.2) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Metric, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 2) +\n  labs(title = \"Time Series\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Value\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma, breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 4)) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, we ought to make some general observations:\n\nPopulation went from 280 million in 1999 to 330 million in 2020. This is an approximate growth of 18%.\nDuring the same time period, death increased by 16%, which is less than population growth.\nThe Crude Death Rate (i.e. the number of deaths divided by the total population times 100,000) reflects this: we see a decrease from 680 to 665 This means that the death rate went down 2.2%.\nHowever, and more surprisingly, the age-adjusted death rate decreased by 29%.\n\nA useful way to compare these trends would be to observe the cumulative percentage growth of each metric visualized in a single time series plot:\n\n\nCode\n#Calculating cumulative percentual change for each column\ncdc_usa_grouped_cum &lt;- cdc_usa_grouped |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Deaths = Deaths / first(Deaths) - 1,\n    Population = Population / first(Population) - 1,\n    Crude_Rate = Crude_Rate / first(Crude_Rate) - 1,\n    Age_Adj_Rate = Age_Adj_Rate / first(Age_Adj_Rate) - 1\n  )\n\n#pivot_longer this data:\ncdc_usa_grouped_cum &lt;- cdc_usa_grouped_cum |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = \"Metric\", values_to = \"Cumulative Change\")\n\n\n#Creating the time series plot\n\nlabels_for_metric &lt;- c(\"Age-Adjusted Rate\", \"Crude Rate\", \"Deaths\", \"Population\")\n\nggplot(cdc_usa_grouped_cum, aes(x = Year, y = `Cumulative Change`, color = Metric)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.3) +\n  labs(title = \"Cumulative Percentage Change by Year (1999-2020)\", x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Cumulative Percentage Change\", color = \"Metric\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(), breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 8))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) \n\n\n\n\n\nSome key observations:\n\nAs stated before, population growth has been steady in the period.\nBetween 1999 and 2012, Total Deaths were approximately constant while the population grew steadily. This caused the Crude Rate to decrease sharply (denominator increasing). However, from 2013 to 2020, we observed a sharp increase in Deaths, growing around 10% in 7 years. An issue we should mention is that COVID-19 exacerbated the severity of other diseases, causing more deaths, which were categorized not as COVID-19 directly. For this dataset, though COVID-19 is omitted, the effect of the pandemic is visible as spikes in 2020.\nAlthough population growth lost some steam from 2013 to 2020, the real cause of the increase in the crude rate of deaths is a sharp increase in deaths.\nWhile the crude rate increased considerably during the period, the age-adjusted death rate kept decreasing. This metric takes into consideration the age distribution of people. If deaths increase because people are aging, it assigns a lesser weight to the metric by weighing the age buckets. This means the metric can be compared across populations with different age structures. Overall, we can say that the increase in deaths has been primarily due to an aging population.\nWe can observe how the population has aged by observing the Population Pyramids for the United States in the image below. The U.S. Census Bureau created the Pyramid Population charts that show how the US has aged in the last two decades. We will later break down by cause and see if we can confirm this intuition.\nFinally, the relatively milder uptick in the Age-Adjusted-Death-Rate in 2020 versus the Crude Rate can be interpreted as COVID causing more deaths in elderly people. The last went up 3.5% that year, while the former was 4.5%.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Understanding the underlying causes of death\nAccording to the CDC, the best metric to study the evolution of death rates is using age-adjusted death rates. We then begin by investigating age-adjusted death rates across time.\n\n\nCode\n#Creating a faceting chart, which will have age adjusted death rates by cause of death:\ndf_usa_cause &lt;- cdc_usa |&gt; select(Year, Cause, Age_Adj_Rate)\nggplot(df_usa_cause, aes(x = Year, y = Age_Adj_Rate, group = Cause, color = Cause)) +\n  geom_line(size = 0.5) + # Thicker lines\n  facet_wrap(~ Cause, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(title = \"Time Series of Causes of Death in the USA\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Age Adjusted Death Rate\")+ \n  guides(color = \"none\") +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can make the following observations:\n\nAs seen before, the overall age-adjusted death rate in the United States has in aggregate decreased since 1999.\nHowever, not all causes share the same decreasing shape. For instance, Alzheimer’s, Unintentional injuries, and suicide have been increasing dramatically.\nOverall, Cancer, CLRD (Chronic lower respiratory diseases), Heart diseases, Kidney diseases, and Strokes have shown an impressive reduction in deaths.\nDiabetes seems to be a cause for concern, but could possibly be explained by the COVID-19 spike (i.e. “…underlying medical conditions can increase the risk of severe illness and a higher likelihood of lethality if a person contracts COVID-19, including diabetes.”\n\nSince different types of causes don’t share the same dimensions, we can compare the changes in death rates by investigating the percentage growth over time:\n\n\nCode\ncdc_usa_wider &lt;- df_usa_cause |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(\n    id_cols = Year,\n    names_from = Cause,\n    values_from = Age_Adj_Rate\n  )\n\n#Calculating cumulative percentual change for each column\ncdc_usa_wider &lt;- cdc_usa_wider |&gt; mutate(across(-Year, ~ ./first(.) - 1))\n\n\n#pivot_longer this data:\ncdc_usa_wider &lt;- cdc_usa_wider |&gt; pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = \"Metric\", values_to = \"Cumulative Change\")\n\n#We use a color blind friendly palette\ncolor_blind_friendly &lt;- c(\"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\", \n                          \"#0072B2\", \"#D55E00\", \"#CC79A7\", \"#999999\", \n                          \"#882255\", \"#88CCEE\")\n\n#Creating the time series plot\nggplot(cdc_usa_wider, aes(x = Year, y = `Cumulative Change`, color = Metric)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Cumulative Change in Age Adjusted Death Rates\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Cumulative Percentage Change\", color = \"Metric\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(), breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 8))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = color_blind_friendly) \n\n\n\n\n\nWith the cumulative percentage time series graph broken down by cause, we can pinpoint some interesting trends and better understand the results over time. In particular, deaths caused by Alzheimer’s disease are aggressively increasing year by year. Unintentional injuries and suicide are the number two and number three fastest-growing causes of death, respectively. Additionally, we can note that stroke, influenza/pneumonia, and heart disease have actually been decreasing during the same time of 1999-2020. We should note that death from stroke, influenza/pneumonia, and heart disease showed a decreasing trend until 2012, but then began to grow again.\nThe overall trend is downward for the age-adjusted death rate. However, we have identified three causes that show different behavior. We will now shift our focus to Alzheimer’s disease, unintentional injuries, and suicide. We will identify which states are leading in these metrics. We suspect some states might come up as outliers.\n\n\n3.1.4 Disaggregating by state\n\n\nCode\n#Filter the data for the specified conditions\ndf_rank1 &lt;- cdc_dataset |&gt; filter(State != 'United States') |&gt;\n  select(Year, State, Cause, Age_Adj_Rate)|&gt; \n  filter(Year %in% c(1999, 2020), Cause == \"Alzheimer's disease\")\n\n# Calculating the percentual difference change from 2000 to 2017 for each state\ndf_rank1 &lt;- df_rank1 %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = Age_Adj_Rate) |&gt;\n  mutate(PercentChange = `2020`/`1999`-1) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(PercentChange))\n\n\n#Cleveland\nggplot(df_rank1, aes(x = PercentChange, y = reorder(State, PercentChange))) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, color = \"darkgreen\") +\n  labs(title = \"Alzheimer's %Chg. in Age-Adj Death Rate\", x = \"Percentage Change 1999 to 2020\", y = 'State') +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(colour = \"grey60\", linetype = \"dashed\"))+\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(), breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 8))+\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that Mississippi, Arkansas, and Alabama have seen the largest increase, while Maine, Maryland, and Montana are the smallest.\n\n\nCode\n#Filter the data for the specified conditions\ndf_rank2 &lt;- cdc_dataset |&gt; filter(State != 'United States') |&gt;\n  select(Year, State, Cause, Age_Adj_Rate)|&gt; \n  filter(Year %in% c(1999, 2020), Cause == \"Unintentional injuries\")\n\n# Calculating the percentual difference change from 2000 to 2017 for each state\ndf_rank2 &lt;- df_rank2 %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = Age_Adj_Rate) |&gt;\n  mutate(PercentChange = `2020`/`1999`-1) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(PercentChange))\n\n\n#Cleveland\nggplot(df_rank2, aes(x = PercentChange, y = reorder(State, PercentChange))) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, color = \"darkblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Unintent.

There are only a few exceptions such as Nevada and Rhode Island in Suicide or Maine in Alzheimer’s where a decreasing rate has been seen. For this reason, we believe it is worth looking at box plots to identify outliers and find explanations for them.\n\n\nCode\ndf_box &lt;- rbind(\n  df_rank1[, c(\"State\", \"Cause\", \"PercentChange\")],\n  df_rank2[, c(\"State\", \"Cause\", \"PercentChange\")],\n  df_rank3[, c(\"State\", \"Cause\", \"PercentChange\")]\n)\n\nggplot(df_box, aes(x = Cause, y = PercentChange)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"#A6CF98\", color = \"black\") + \n  theme_bw() + labs(title = \"Box-Plot: Percent Change by Cause - 1999 to 2020 - by States\", x = \"Cause\", y = \"Percent Change\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\n\n\n\n\n\nMatching these values with the previous Cleveland dot plots, we can say that Mississippi is an outlier for Alzheimer’s. Rhode Island and West Virginia are outliers for Unintentional Injuries. Finally, Suicide does not seem to not have any outliers. From the boxplots, we also notice that the three causes are skewed to the right.\n\n\n3.1.5 Analyzing Alzheimer’s Disease\nApparently, the states most affected by Alzheimer’s are in the southern part of the United States. Given the possible geographical dependence, we propose to corroborate the information with the following geospatial visualization.\nWe will identify the top 6 states, which have the highest growing deaths due to Alzheimer’s.\n\n\nCode\n#We calculate the 88th percentile (top 12% threshold)\ntop_10_percent_threshold &lt;- quantile(df_rank1$PercentChange, probs = 0.88, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n#We create a new variable to indicate top 12%\ndf_rank1$Top10Percent &lt;- ifelse(df_rank1$PercentChange &gt; top_10_percent_threshold, \"Top 12%\", \"Below Top 12%\")\n\n#For the merge to work, we ensure that state names in both datasets are in lowercase for successful merging\ndf_rank1$State &lt;- tolower(df_rank1$State)\nstates_map &lt;- map_data(\"state\")\nstates_map$region &lt;- tolower(states_map$region)\n\n#Merging the datasets\ndf_map &lt;- merge(states_map, df_rank1, by.x = \"region\", by.y = \"State\", all.x = TRUE)\n\n#We plot the map\nggplot(data = df_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = Top10Percent)) +\n    geom_polygon(color = \"black\") +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Top 12%\" = \"red\", \"Below Top 12%\" = \"grey\"), \n                      labels = c(\"Below Top 12%\", \"Top 12%\")) +\n    labs(fill = \"Category\") +\n    theme_bw() +\n    theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n          axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n          axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank()) +\n    coord_fixed(1.4) +\n    labs(title = \"Top 6 States with highest Death Rates due to Alzheimer's\") + theme(legend.position=\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThis cluster identifies 6 southern states that have had the largest increase in deaths due to Alzheimer’s (age-adjusted).\nAccording to this study: https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/data-shows-racial-disparities-alzheimers-disease-diagnosis-between-black-and-white-research, black people are almost twice more likely to develop dementia due to higher exposure to risk factors. For this reason, we will investigate black race distribution by state.\nFirst, let’s take a look if there is indeed a difference between the Age-Adjusted Death Rate of Black vs White people:\n\n\nCode\n#Loading cases of Alzheimer distinguished by race across time: \ncdc_dataset_race = read_csv(\"NCHS_Leading_Causes_of_Death_United_States_2020_Race.csv\")\ncdc_dataset_race &lt;- cdc_dataset_race |&gt; mutate_all(~ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .))\ncdc_usa_race = cdc_dataset_race |&gt; filter(State == \"United States\") |&gt; select(Year, Race, Age_Adj_Death_Rate)\n\n\n#Pivot wider:\ncdc_usa_race &lt;- cdc_usa_race |&gt; pivot_wider(names_from = Race, values_from = Age_Adj_Death_Rate)\ncdc_usa_race &lt;- cdc_usa_race |&gt; mutate(across(-Year, ~ ./first(.) - 1))\n\n#pivot_longer this data:\ncdc_usa_race &lt;- cdc_usa_race |&gt; pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = \"Alzheimer\", values_to = \"Cumulative Change\")\n\n\n#Creating the time series plot\nggplot(cdc_usa_race, aes(x = Year, y = `Cumulative Change`, color = Alzheimer)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.3) +\n  labs(title = \"Cumulative Percentage Change ('99-'20) - Alzheimer - Age Adjusted Death Rate\", x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Cumulative Percentage Change\", color = \"Race\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(), breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 8))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10))\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, we can see a difference in age-adjusted death dates when broken down by race. The black population has seen an increase in its death rate by over 160%. Conversely, the White population has seen an increase of 95% during the same last 20 years.\nNext, we can explore the distribution of the Black population by state. We will take an averages across this time period. This following chart identifies 10 states that have the highest proportion of Black population in the US:\n\n\nCode\ncdc_usa_race_pop = read_csv(\"NCHS_United_States_2020_Race_Distribution.csv\")\ncdc_usa_race_pop = cdc_usa_race_pop |&gt; group_by(Race, State) |&gt; summarize(Population = mean(Population))\ncdc_usa_race_pop &lt;- cdc_usa_race_pop |&gt; pivot_wider(names_from = Race, values_from = Population)\ncdc_usa_race_pop$Total = cdc_usa_race_pop$Black + cdc_usa_race_pop$White\ncdc_usa_race_pop$Black = cdc_usa_race_pop$Black/cdc_usa_race_pop$Total\ncdc_usa_race_pop = cdc_usa_race_pop |&gt; select(State, Black)\n\n\n#We calculate the 88th percentile (top 12% threshold)\ncdc_usa_race_pop_threshold &lt;- quantile(cdc_usa_race_pop$Black, probs = 0.80, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n#We create a new variable\ncdc_usa_race_pop$TopPercent &lt;- ifelse(cdc_usa_race_pop$Black &gt; cdc_usa_race_pop_threshold, \"Top 25%\", \"Below Top 25%\")\n\n#For the merge to work, we ensure that state names in both datasets are in lowercase for successful merging\ncdc_usa_race_pop$State &lt;- tolower(cdc_usa_race_pop$State)\nstates_map &lt;- map_data(\"state\")\nstates_map$region &lt;- tolower(states_map$region)\n\n#Merging the datasets\ndf_map &lt;- merge(states_map, cdc_usa_race_pop, by.x = \"region\", by.y = \"State\", all.x = TRUE)\n\n#We plot the map\nggplot(data = df_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = TopPercent)) +\n    geom_polygon(color = \"black\") +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Top 25%\" = \"blue\", \"Below Top 25%\" = \"grey\"), \n                      labels = c(\"Below Top 25%\", \"Top 25%\")) +\n    labs(fill = \"Category\") +\n    theme_bw() +\n    theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n          axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n          axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank()) +\n    coord_fixed(1.4) +\n    labs(title = \"Top 10 States with highest proportion of Black People\") + theme(legend.position=\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# df_map %&gt;% filter(TopPercent ==\"Top 25%\") %&gt;% distinct(region)\n\n\nAlthough not perfect, there is some overlap. We see a strong correlation that supports the study: select southern states have a higher proportion of the population comprised of Black people, and it coincides with the states that have had higher increases in deaths due to Alzheimer’s disease.\nAdditionally, according to the CDC, Alzheimer’s onset is around 60 years old. It’s interesting to note that there has been a general increase in life expectancy for people born between 1939 and 1960. In 1999, they would have reached 60 years old, which is around the age of first onset. Life expectancy rose from 63.7 to 69.7 years old. Naturally, we see a very high positive correlation (0.88) between the increase in deaths due to Alzheimer’s disease and the rise in life expectancy.\n\n\nCode\ndf_life_expectancy &lt;- read_csv(\"NCHS_-_Death_rates_and_life_expectancy_at_birth_20231111.csv\")\n#df_life_expectancy\n\ndf_life_expectancy_1939_to_1960 = df_life_expectancy %&gt;% filter(Race == \"All Races\") %&gt;% filter(Sex == \"Both Sexes\") %&gt;% filter(Year &gt;= 1939) %&gt;% filter(Year &lt;= 1960)  %&gt;% select(-Race,-Sex,-`Age-adjusted Death Rate`)\n#df_life_expectancy_1939_to_1960\n\nalzheimer_crude = cdc_usa %&gt;% filter(Cause == \"Alzheimer's disease\") %&gt;% select(Year, Cause,Crude_Rate)\n#alzheimer_crude\n\nexpectancy_alzheimer_regression_2 = cbind(alzheimer_crude,df_life_expectancy_1939_to_1960)\n\n#expectancy_alzheimer_regression_2 # this is the table\n\nggplot(expectancy_alzheimer_regression_2 %&gt;% select(`Crude_Rate`,`Average Life Expectancy (Years)`), aes(x = `Average Life Expectancy (Years)`, y = `Crude_Rate`)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") + \n  labs(x = \"Average Life Expectancy\", y = \"Crude Rate\", title = \"Scatterplot Regression for Alzheimer's Crude Rate vs Life Expectancy (1999 - 2020)\") + \n  labs(caption = \"Correlation coefficient R = 0.88 \") +\n  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust=.1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ny = expectancy_alzheimer_regression_2$`Crude_Rate`\nx = expectancy_alzheimer_regression_2$`Average Life Expectancy (Years)`\n\nregression_model_cumul_growth &lt;- lm(y ~ x)\ncor.test(y,x)\n\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  y and x\nt = 8.2172, df = 20, p-value = 7.687e-08\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.7253415 0.9486506\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.8783436 \n\n\n\n\n3.1.6 Analyzing Unintentional Injuries\nA bulk of what is categorized under unintentional injuries are drug overdoses. Over the last few years, the opioid epidemic has made national headlines. The CDC has stated that “prescription opioids (natural and semi-synthetic opioids and methadone) increasing since at least 1999.”\nThe CDC describes that there have been several waves of deaths. The increasing rate of opioid prescriptions since 1999 has been contributing to overdose deaths. Unfortunately, this coincides with another phenomenon: fentanyl trafficking. This became a crisis in 2014. What is referred to as the “third wave” of deaths started after 2013. This is an extremely dramatic increase in overdose deaths. Additionally, Purdue Pharma has been at the center of a controversy due to illegal kickbacks to doctors and as well as health records company. One of the things that became interesting to look into is prescription opioid dispense rate by state.\nOne of the things that became interesting to look into is the prescription opioid dispense rate by state. This data set is available from the CDC.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\ndf_opiod &lt;- read_csv(\"NCHS_Opiod_Dispense.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf_opiod_state = df_opiod %&gt;% filter(State != 'United States')\ndf_opiod_state = df_opiod_state %&gt;% select(-StateAbb)\ndf_opiod_state_arranged =  df_opiod_state %&gt;% arrange(desc(OpiodDispenseRatePer100))\n\n\nz = df_opiod_state_arranged %&gt;% filter(Year &lt;= 2020) %&gt;% group_by(State) %&gt;% summarize(Avg = mean(OpiodDispenseRatePer100)) %&gt;% arrange(desc(Avg)) %&gt;% filter(Avg &gt; 95)\nz_reverse = z[order(z$Avg), ]\n#z_reverse\n\n# ggplot(df_opiod_state_arranged %&gt;% filter(Year &lt;= 2020) %&gt;% group_by(State) %&gt;% summarize(Avg = mean(OpiodDispenseRatePer100)) %&gt;% arrange(desc(Avg)) %&gt;% filter(Avg &gt; 95), aes(x = State, y = Avg)) +\n#   geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = '#8B4513')\n  \n\n\ndotchart(z_reverse$Avg, labels = z_reverse$State,\n         cex = 0.9, xlab = \"Opioid Dispense Rate Per 100\", main = \"Top 8 Highest States with Average Opioid Dispense Rate for 2006-2020\")\n\n\n\n\n\nAveraging the rate of opioid dispensing (via pharmacies and medical facilities), here are the top 8 highest states that were dispensing the most amount of prescription opioids.\n\n\nCode\ndf_opiod_state_arranged_top5_states = df_opiod_state_arranged %&gt;% filter(State == \"West Virginia\" | State == \"Alabama\" | State == \"Tennessee\" | State == \"Kentucky\" | State == \"Arkansas\" | State == \"Mississippi\" | State == \"Oklahoma\" | State == \"Louisiana\")\n\n# df_opiod_state_arranged_top5_states\n  \nggplot(df_opiod_state_arranged_top5_states, aes(x = as.numeric(Year), y = OpiodDispenseRatePer100, color = State)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")  +\n  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust=.1)) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Opioid Dispense rate Per 100\", title = \"Opioid Dispense Rate for Top 8 States (2006 - 2020)\") + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2006:2020)\n\n\n\n\n\nUtilizing a time series, we can observe that these states accelerated in dispensing opioids and then dramatically decreased the opioid dispensing around 2012. Naturally, it’s interesting to see which states have had the highest death rates due to unintentional injuries.\n\n\nCode\ntop5_states_adj_rate_unint = cdc_dataset %&gt;% filter(State != \"United States\") %&gt;% filter(Cause == \"Unintentional injuries\") %&gt;% filter(Year &gt; 2005)\ntop5_states_adj_rate_unint = top5_states_adj_rate_unint %&gt;% group_by(State) %&gt;% summarize(Avg = mean(Age_Adj_Rate)) %&gt;% arrange(desc(Avg)) %&gt;% filter(Avg &gt; 57)# %&gt;% filter(Avg &gt; 57.4)\n#top5_states_adj_rate_unint\n\nw = top5_states_adj_rate_unint\n#w\n\nw_reverse = w[order(w$Avg), ]\n#w_reverse\n\n\n\ndotchart(w_reverse$Avg, labels = w_reverse$State,gcolor = \"green\",\n         cex = 0.9, xlab = \"Age Adjusted Death Rate\", main = \"Top 8 Highest States w/ Avg Age-Adj Death Rate for Unintentional '06-'20\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nselected_top5 = cdc_dataset %&gt;% filter(Cause == \"Unintentional injuries\") %&gt;% \n  filter(State == \"West Virginia\" | State == \"New Mexico\" | State == \"Kentucky\" | State == \"Mississippi\" | State == \"Alaska\" | State == \"Wyoming\" | State == \"Oklahoma\" | State == \"Tennessee\")  %&gt;% filter(Year &gt; 2005)\n\n\n  \n# selected_top5\n\n\nggplot(selected_top5, aes(x = as.numeric(Year), y = Age_Adj_Rate, color = State)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Age Adjust Death Rate\", title = \"Age Adjusted Death Rate for Unintentional for Top 8 States (2006 - 2020)\") + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2006:2020)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is notable about the Unintentional deaths in these top 8 states is that they start to climb. This could be due to the fact that people initially developed addictions during the years of aggressive dispensing. Then, after a few years’ delay, the death rates started to increase, especially with the arrival of fentanyl.\n\n\nCode\nopiod_top8 = df_opiod_state_arranged_top5_states %&gt;% distinct(State)\n# opiod_top8$State\n\ndeath_rate_top8 = selected_top5 %&gt;% distinct(State)\n# death_rate_top8$State\n\nintersect(opiod_top8$State,death_rate_top8$State)\n\n\n[1] \"West Virginia\" \"Tennessee\"     \"Kentucky\"      \"Oklahoma\"     \n[5] \"Mississippi\"  \n\n\nWe see that by choosing 8 states that have had the highest average death rate from 2006 to 2020 and choosing 8 states that have had the highest average opioid dispensing, we can see that 5 of the states intersect. There is significant overlap between the states that had the highest average opioid dispensing rates and the states that had the highest average death rates.\n\n\n3.1.7 Analyzing Suicide\nThis topic is extremely broad and difficult to summarize. There are many life factors such as depression, mental illness, lack of access to mental health care, isolation, and quality of life that can contribute to the rising rates. However, there is a peculiar pattern that emerges in terms of population density and suicide rates. Consider these top 10 states with the highest average suicide rates:\n\n\nCode\ntop10_avg_suicide_states = cdc_dataset %&gt;% filter(State != \"United States\") %&gt;% filter(Cause == \"Suicide\") %&gt;% group_by(State) %&gt;% summarize(Avg = mean(Age_Adj_Rate)) %&gt;% arrange(desc(Avg)) %&gt;% filter(Avg &gt; 16.9)\n#top10_avg_suicide_states\n\n# library(knitr)\n# kable(top10_avg_suicide_states %&gt;% mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 2))))\n# \n# library(huxtable)\n# hux(top10_avg_suicide_states)\n# \nlibrary(flextable)\nflextable(top10_avg_suicide_states %&gt;% mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 2))))\n\n\n\nStateAvgWyoming22.60Alaska22.56Montana22.15New Mexico20.64Nevada19.44Idaho18.53Utah18.44Colorado18.01Oklahoma16.98Arizona16.93\n\n\nCode\n# library(formattable)\n# formattable()\n\n\nThese states have had the highest suicide rate on average from 1999 to 2020. We can see that there is an interesting relationship between where most suicides tend to occur and the type of state it is. In particular, many of these states tend to have a sparse population density. In other words, the land mass tends to be big compared to the population residing on that land mass. We import a data set to isolate states that have a lower population density. Consider this next table of lowest population densities in the US by state:\n\n\nCode\nunited_states_by_area &lt;- read_csv(\"united-states-by-area.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n# View(united_states_by_area)\n\nunited_states_by_area_density = united_states_by_area %&gt;% select(state,densityMi) %&gt;% arrange(densityMi)\ncolnames(united_states_by_area_density) &lt;- c('State','densityMi')\n#united_states_by_area_density\n\nlowest_population_density_states = united_states_by_area_density[1:10,]\n#lowest_population_density_states\n\nflextable(lowest_population_density_states %&gt;% mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 2))))\n\n\n\nStatedensityMiAlaska1.28Wyoming6.01Montana7.83North Dakota11.31South Dakota12.18New Mexico17.40Idaho23.88Nebraska25.67Nevada29.23Kansas35.92\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# lowest_population_density_states %&gt;% distinct(State)\n#as.vector(top10_avg_suicide_states %&gt;% distinct(State))\n\na = lowest_population_density_states %&gt;% distinct(State)\n#a$State\n\nb = top10_avg_suicide_states %&gt;% distinct(State)\n#b$State\n\nintersect(a$State,b$State)\n\n\n[1] \"Alaska\"     \"Wyoming\"    \"Montana\"    \"New Mexico\" \"Idaho\"     \n[6] \"Nevada\"    \n\n\nThere is a peculiar pattern that emerges. Comparing the top 10 states for the lowest population density and the top 8 states for the highest suicide rate, there is an overlap of 6 states.\n\n\nCode\navg_suicide_rate = cdc_dataset %&gt;% filter(State != \"United States\") %&gt;% filter(Cause == \"Suicide\") %&gt;% group_by(State) %&gt;% summarize(Avg = mean(Age_Adj_Rate)) %&gt;% arrange(desc(Avg))\n# avg_suicide_rate\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmerged_df &lt;- merge(united_states_by_area_density, avg_suicide_rate, by = \"State\")\n# merged_df\n\n\n\n\nCode\nboxplot(united_states_by_area_density$densityMi,\n        main = \"Boxplot of Population Density per Square Mile\",  \n        xlab = \"States\",                    \n        ylab = \"Population density (# of people per sq. mile)\")             \n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that there are some outliers in terms of population density (i.e. 6 states are very densely populated). The distribution is right-skewed. This is a good candidate to do a log transform to further analyze the data in terms of how it relates to the average suicide rate over the last 20 years. After joining the data on the state, we can run a linear regression.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(merged_df, aes(x = log(densityMi), y = Avg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") + \n  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust=.1)) + \n  labs(caption = \"Correlation coefficient R = -0.860 \")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ny = merged_df$Avg\nx = log(merged_df$densityMi)\nregression_model_cumul_growth &lt;- lm(y ~ x)\ncor.test(y,x)\n\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  y and x\nt = -11.724, df = 48, p-value = 1.081e-15\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.9190277 -0.7661560\nsample estimates:\n       cor \n-0.8609083 \n\n\nCode\n# summary(regression_model_cumul_growth)\n\n\nWe observe a remarkable pattern: suicide is highly (negatively) correlated with population density. For example, Wyoming has a suicide rate that is over 3 times higher than New York. Hence, areas that have high population density tend to have lower rates of suicide. Areas that have low population density tend to have high rates of suicide. The correlation coefficient found here is -0.86, which is quite high."

    "text": "Instructions: select one of the top 3 causes of death in the United States from the options menu.\n\nThe first map (i.e. map with bubbles) shows which states have the highest age-adjusted death rate (expressed as the value per 100,000 people). Thus, a bigger bubble corresponds to a higher rate.\nThe second map (i.e. heatmap) shows which states have seen the most significant increase expressed as a percentage change from 1999 to 2020. The more red the state is colored, the higher the increase is.\n\nHence, we can examine two metrics simultaneously: age-adjusted death rate in the first map and percentage change in the second map.\n\nFor example: consider choosing Alzheimer’s Disease and focusing on Mississippi. The bubble map shows that Mississippi has had the highest age-adjusted death rate due to Alzheimer’s in the United States: 58 deaths per 100,000 people. Moreover, not only does it have the highest death rate, but it has seen the largest growth since 1999 in this metric: a 336% increase. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource:\nhttps://plotly.com/javascript/bubble-maps/\nhttps://plotly.com/javascript/choropleth-maps/"

    "text": "Our deep dive into CDC data from 1999 to 2000 has clarified a  central question: Alzheimer’s disease, suicide, and unintentional injuries have had the most dramatic percentage increase in the last two decades.\nThere is a notable correlation between rising life expectancy and the increase in Alzheimer’s disease. Today, a larger portion of the population is likely to reach the age where the risk of Alzheimer’s disease is significantly higher. In particular, 60 years old and above is the period where the likelihood of Alzheimer’s disease becomes elevated. Furthermore, according to the CDC, Black people are almost twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease. The rising mortality rates have been observed particularly in several southern states, including Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana, which have a significant black population proportion.\nA key observation was made regarding the correlation between high opioid dispensing rates and unintentional injury deaths. The states that had the highest average opioid dispensing rates and the states that had the highest average death rates had a significant overlap. In particular, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Mississippi. The opioid epidemic has had several waves of mortalities in the last decade. Our visualization across the entire United States showed that the most devastating of these waves occurred after 2013 coinciding with fentanyl trafficking. After this point, the death rate has been soaring ever since.\nWe wanted to find a correlation that seemed a bit surprising. One striking observation was the strong negative correlation between population density and suicide. Though the pattern seems a bit surprising, it shines a light on geographical isolation, which can exacerbate loneliness. According to the CDC, loneliness is associated with higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide. This relationship between geographical isolation and loneliness is quantitatively expressed via population density regression analysis. In summary, the project confirmed some expected trends while revealing surprising patterns."
