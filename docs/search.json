Provide context for readers who are not familiar with the topic.\n(suggested: 1 page)\nThe CDC is a national public health institute in the United States, dedicated to protecting health and promoting quality of life through the prevention and control of disease, injury, and disability. The CDC provides free access to a wealth of public health data and resources.\nSpecifically, we are going to work with the ICD-10 113 Cause List, which holds significant importance within the framework of the International Classification of Diseases. In particular this is the 10th Revision (ICD-10), which is widely acknowledged as a universally accepted standard for the systematic classification of health conditions and the determination of causes of mortality."

    "text": "2.1 Technical description\n\n2.1.1 Data collection\nWe are going to work with data related to deaths published by the The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The data is collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), specifically by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). This involves gathering mortality and population data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), which receives information from state and local health departments in the United States.\n\n\n2.1.2 Description of the data\n\nFormat: The dataset is publicly available in CSV files in the following website: https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html\nFrequency: Annually updated from 1999 to 2020\nFeatures: key features include causes of death, demographic information (race, sex, age) and geographic location (state).\nDimensions: the dataset provides the following metrics:\n\nDeaths: number of deaths that ocurred in a specific year, for a specific race, sex, state.\nPopulation: the total popoulation for that specific year, race, state etc.\nCrude Death Rate: number of deaths divided total population\nAge Adjusted Death Rate: number o deaths adjusted by age\n\nSpecific description: The main dataset has 37290 rows and 8 columns.\n\nIt is important to differentiate between age-adjusted death rate, deaths and crude death rate. While the three of them provide information about mortality, we will focus on Age-Adjusted-Death-Rate: the Crude Rate is a measure of the number of deaths in a given population, scaled to the size of that population, per unit of time. It is not adjusted for the age distribution of a population. An increase in the Crude Rate could be due to several factors, including an increase in the absolute number of deaths, a growing proportion of older individuals in the population who are more likely to die, or a decrease in the overall population size. On the other hand, the Age Adjusted Rate, or Age Adjusted Death Rate, is a mortality rate statistically modified to eliminate the effect of different age distributions in different populations. This rate is typically used to allow comparisons between populations that may have different age structures. A good explanation of the different can be found here: https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/chronic/ageadj.htm\n\nImporting the data: the dataset can be obtained frm the CDC webiste in a CSV format. Then we will import it into R using read_csv() function. The dataset will be stored in the repository.\nNote any issues / problems with the data:\n\nIn general there are no problems with the data in terms of inconsistencies. Numbers are sound and we did not encounter any number that seemed to be inherently wrong. However, the CDC does not calculate Age-Adjusted-Death-Rate or Crude-Death-Rate when the number of absolute Deaths is less than or equal to 10. Instead, they are labeled as Unrealiable. In any case, the number would be quite small, and we can treat Unreliable measures as zero.\n\n\nWe can take a look to the first few rows of the dataset:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\ncdc_dataset = read_csv(\"NCHS_Leading_Causes_of_Death_United_States_2020.csv\")\nprint(head(cdc_dataset, 20))\n\n\n# A tibble: 20 × 8\n    Year `113 Cause Name`      `Cause Name` State Deaths Population `Crude Rate`\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  1999 Tuberculosis (A16-A1… Tuberculosis Alab…     16    4430141         NA  \n 2  1999 Septicemia (A40-A41)  Septicemia   Alab…    691    4430141         15.6\n 3  1999 Viral hepatitis (B15… Viral hepat… Alab…     63    4430141          1.4\n 4  1999 Human immunodeficien… Human immun… Alab…    177    4430141          4  \n 5  1999 Malignant neoplasms … Cancer       Alab…   9506    4430141        215. \n 6  1999 In situ neoplasms, b… In situ neo… Alab…    237    4430141          5.3\n 7  1999 Anemias (D50-D64)     Anemias      Alab…    110    4430141          2.5\n 8  1999 Diabetes mellitus (E… Diabetes     Alab…   1341    4430141         30.3\n 9  1999 Nutritional deficien… Nutritional… Alab…     85    4430141          1.9\n10  1999 Meningitis (G00,G03)  Meningitis   Alab…     11    4430141         NA  \n11  1999 Parkinson disease (G… Parkinson d… Alab…    207    4430141          4.7\n12  1999 Alzheimer disease (G… Alzheimer's… Alab…    772    4430141         17.4\n13  1999 Diseases of heart (I… Heart disea… Alab…  13419    4430141        303. \n14  1999 Essential hypertensi… Essential h… Alab…    313    4430141          7.1\n15  1999 Cerebrovascular dise… Stroke       Alab…   3148    4430141         71.1\n16  1999 Atherosclerosis (I70) Atheroscler… Alab…    215    4430141          4.9\n17  1999 Aortic aneurysm and … Aortic aneu… Alab…    224    4430141          5.1\n18  1999 Influenza and pneumo… Influenza a… Alab…   1228    4430141         27.7\n19  1999 Chronic lower respir… CLRD         Alab…   2179    4430141         49.2\n20  1999 Pneumoconioses and c… Pneumoconio… Alab…     20    4430141          0.5\n# ℹ 1 more variable: `Age Adjusted Rate` &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nCode\nrm(cdc_dataset)"

It’s is visible that heart disease and cancer account for a significant bulk of all deaths. We will focus our analysis on these.\n\n\nCode\n#Filtering cdc_dataset by the top 10 Cause Name from cdc_usa_summary\ncdc_dataset &lt;- cdc_dataset[cdc_dataset$Cause %in%  cdc_usa_summary$Cause, ]\ncdc_usa  &lt;- cdc_usa[cdc_usa$Cause %in%  cdc_usa_summary$Cause, ]\nrm(cdc_usa_summary)\n\n\nNotice that the deaths incorporated in these 10 categories, are almost 90% of the total figure of deaths.\n\n\n3.1.2 Understanding overall trends\nAs population grows, deaths (with a lag) will eventually grow. We would like to understand the interplay between population growth, deaths growth, and the evolution of death rates since 1999. For this, we will create metrics and facet them in time series.\n\n\nCode\n#Grouping by Year and State, and summarizing the data. We can take min(Population) to keep the population of that year\ncdc_usa_grouped &lt;- cdc_usa |&gt; group_by(Year) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    Deaths = sum(Deaths),\n    Population = min(Population),\n    Crude_Rate = sum(Crude_Rate),\n    Age_Adj_Rate = sum(Age_Adj_Rate),\n    .groups = 'drop'\n  )\n\n\n#Reshaping data using pivot_longer so we can facet by metric:\ncdc_usa_long &lt;- cdc_usa_grouped |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(Deaths, Population, Crude_Rate, Age_Adj_Rate), names_to = \"Metric\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\n#Adjusting the order and names of the metrics\ncdc_usa_long$Metric &lt;- factor(cdc_usa_long$Metric, \n                                      levels = c(\"Population\", \"Crude_Rate\", \"Deaths\", \"Age_Adj_Rate\"),\n                                      labels = c(\"Population in US\", \"Crude Death Rate\", \"Deaths\", \"Age Adjusted Death Rate\"))\n\n#Creating the time series:\nggplot(cdc_usa_long, aes(x = Year, y = Value)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#FF6C22\", size = 1.2) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Metric, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 2) +\n  labs(title = \"Time Series\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Value\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma, breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 4)) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s make some general observations:\n\nPopulation went from 280 millions in 1999 to 330 in 2020. This is an approximate growth of 18%.\nIn the same period, death increased by 16%, which is less than population growth.\nThe Crude Death Rate, which is simply the number of deaths divided by the total population reflects this fact going down to 665 from 680. This means that the death rate went down 2.2%.\nHowever, and more surprising, age adjusted death rate reduced 29%.\n\nA good way to compare the trends, would be to observe the cumulative perceptual growth of each metric, in a single time series plot:\n\n\nCode\n#Calculating cumulative percentual change for each column\ncdc_usa_grouped_cum &lt;- cdc_usa_grouped |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Deaths = Deaths / first(Deaths) - 1,\n    Population = Population / first(Population) - 1,\n    Crude_Rate = Crude_Rate / first(Crude_Rate) - 1,\n    Age_Adj_Rate = Age_Adj_Rate / first(Age_Adj_Rate) - 1\n  )\n\n#pivot_longer this data:\ncdc_usa_grouped_cum &lt;- cdc_usa_grouped_cum |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = \"Metric\", values_to = \"Cumulative Change\")\n\n\n#Creating the time series plot\nggplot(cdc_usa_grouped_cum, aes(x = Year, y = `Cumulative Change`, color = Metric)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.3) +\n  labs(title = \"Cumulative Percentual Change (1999-2020)\", x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Cumulative Percentual Change\", color = \"Metric\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(), breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 8))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10))\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral observations:\n\nAs stated before, population growth has been steady in the period.\nBetween 1999 and 2012, Total Deaths were approximately constant while the population grew steadily. This provoked the Crude Rate to decrease sharply (denominator increasing). However, from 2013 to 2020, we observed a sharp increase in Deaths, growing around 10% in 7 years. Interestingly, 6% was given from 2013 to 2019 and 4% in 2020. The issue is that COVID-19 exacerbated the severity of other diseases, causing more deaths, which were categorized not as COVID-19 directly. Remember that in this dataset, we omit COVID-19, but we, in fact, see an effect from the pandemic, which is seen in the spikes of 2020.\nAlthough population growth lost some steam from 2013 to 2020, the real cause of the increase in the crude rate of deaths is a sharp increase in deaths.\nWhile the crude rate increased considerably during the period, the age-adjusted death rate kept decreasing. This metric takes into consideration the age distribution of people. If deaths increase because people are aging, it assigns a lesser weight to the metric by weighting by age buckets. This means the metric can be compared across populations with different age structures. Overall, we can say that the increase in deaths has been primarily due to an aging population.\nWe can observe how the population has aged by observing the Population Pyramids for the United States in the image below. The U.S. Census Bureau created the Pyramid Population charts that show how the US has aged in the last two decades.\nWe say in aggregate because we will break down by cause and see if we can confirm this intuition.\nFinally, the relatively milder uptick in the Age-Adjusted-Death-Rate in 2020 versus the Crude Rate can be interpreted as COVID causing more deaths in elderly people. The last went up 3.5% that year, while the former was 4.5%.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Understanding the underlying causes of death\nAccording to the CDC, the best metric to study death evolution is using age-adjusted death rates. We then begin by investigating the evolution of age adjusted death rate across time.\n\n\nCode\n#Creating a faceting chart, which will have age adjusted death rates by cause of death:\ndf_usa_cause &lt;- cdc_usa |&gt; select(Year, Cause, Age_Adj_Rate)\nggplot(df_usa_cause, aes(x = Year, y = Age_Adj_Rate, group = Cause, color = Cause)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.5) + # Thicker lines\n  facet_wrap(~ Cause, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(title = \"Time Series of Causes of Death in the USA\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Age Adjusted Death Rate\")+ \n  guides(color = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can make the following observations:\n\nAs seen before, the overall age adjusted death rate in the United States is in aggregate decreasing since 1999\nHowever, not all causes share the same decreasing shape. For instance, Alzheimer’s, Unintentional injuries and suicide, have been increasing dramatically.\nOverall, Cancer, CLRD (Chronic lower respiratory diseases), Heart diseases, Kidney diseases and Strokes have shown an impressive reduction in deaths.\nDiabetes seems to be a cause for concern, but it can be explained by COVID-19: “Several underlying medical conditions can increase the risk of severe illness and a higher likelihood of lethality if a person contracts COVID-19, including diabetes”.\n\nThe different types of causes don’t share the same dimensions. We can compare the evolution of these death-rates calculating the percentual growth over time:\n\n\nCode\ncdc_usa_wider &lt;- df_usa_cause |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(\n    id_cols = Year,\n    names_from = Cause,\n    values_from = Age_Adj_Rate\n  )\n\n#Calculating cumulative percentual change for each column\ncdc_usa_wider &lt;- cdc_usa_wider |&gt; mutate(across(-Year, ~ ./first(.) - 1))\n\n\n#pivot_longer this data:\ncdc_usa_wider &lt;- cdc_usa_wider |&gt; pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = \"Metric\", values_to = \"Cumulative Change\")\n\n#We use a color blind friendly palette\ncolor_blind_friendly &lt;- c(\"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\", \n                          \"#0072B2\", \"#D55E00\", \"#CC79A7\", \"#999999\", \n                          \"#882255\", \"#88CCEE\")\n\n#Creating the time series plot\nggplot(cdc_usa_wider, aes(x = Year, y = `Cumulative Change`, color = Metric)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.3) +\n  labs(title = \"Cumulative Change - Age Adj. Deaht Rate\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Cumulative Percentual Change\", color = \"Metric\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(), breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 8))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = color_blind_friendly)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the cumulative percentage time series graph broken down by cause, we can see some interesting trends and better understand the trends over time. In particular, deaths caused by Alzheimer’s disease is aggressively increasing year by year. Unintentional injuries and suicide are the number two and number three fastest growing causes of death, respectively. Additionally, we can note that stroke, influenza and pneumonia, and heart disease have actually been decreasing during the same time of 1999-2020. Those we should note that death from Stroke, Influenza and pneumonia, and heart disease diseases showed a decreasing trend until 2012, but then began to grow again.\nThe overall trend is downward for the age adjusted death rate. However, we have identified three causes that show a different behavior. Now we will try to identify which states are leading in these metrics.\n\n\n3.1.4 Disaggregating by state\n\n\nCode\n#Filter the data for the specified conditions\ndf_rank1 &lt;- cdc_dataset |&gt; filter(State != 'United States') |&gt;\n  select(Year, State, Cause, Age_Adj_Rate)|&gt; \n  filter(Year %in% c(1999, 2020), Cause == \"Alzheimer's disease\")\n\n# Calculating the percentual difference change from 2000 to 2017 for each state\ndf_rank1 &lt;- df_rank1 %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = Age_Adj_Rate) |&gt;\n  mutate(PercentChange = `2020`/`1999`-1) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(PercentChange))\n\n\n#Cleveland\nggplot(df_rank1, aes(x = PercentChange, y = reorder(State, PercentChange))) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, color = \"darkgreen\") +\n  labs(title = \"Alzheimer's Disiease %Chg. in Age Adj.

There are only a few exceptions such as Nevada and Rhode Island in Suicide or Maine in Alzheimer’s where a decreasing rate has been seen. For this reason, we believe it is worth looking at box plots to identify outliers and find explanations for them.\n\n\nCode\ndf_box &lt;- rbind(\n  df_rank1[, c(\"State\", \"Cause\", \"PercentChange\")],\n  df_rank2[, c(\"State\", \"Cause\", \"PercentChange\")],\n  df_rank3[, c(\"State\", \"Cause\", \"PercentChange\")]\n)\n\nggplot(df_box, aes(x = Cause, y = PercentChange)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"#A6CF98\", color = \"black\") + \n  theme_bw() + labs(title = \"Box-Plot: Percent Change by Cause - 1999 to 2020 - by States\", x = \"Cause\", y = \"Percent Change\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\n\n\n\n\n\nMatching these values with the previous cleveland dop plots, we can say that Missisipi is an outlier for Alzheimer. Rhode Island and West Virginia are outliers for Unintentional Injuries. Finally, Suicide seems to not have any outlier. From the boxplots we also notice that the three causes are skewed to the right.\n\n\n3.1.5 Analyzing Alzheimer’s Disease\nApparently the states most affected by Alzheimer’s are in the southern part of the United States. Given the possible geographical dependence, we propose to corroborate the information with the following geospatial visualization.\nTo make the differences more notorious, we are going to paint the top 12% of States in terms growing deaths due to Alzheimer.\n\n\nCode\n#We calculate the 88th percentile (top 12% threshold)\ntop_10_percent_threshold &lt;- quantile(df_rank1$PercentChange, probs = 0.88, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n#We create a new variable to indicate top 12%\ndf_rank1$Top10Percent &lt;- ifelse(df_rank1$PercentChange &gt; top_10_percent_threshold, \"Top 12%\", \"Below Top 12%\")\n\n#For the merge to work, we ensure that state names in both datasets are in lowercase for successful merging\ndf_rank1$State &lt;- tolower(df_rank1$State)\nstates_map &lt;- map_data(\"state\")\nstates_map$region &lt;- tolower(states_map$region)\n\n#Merging the datasets\ndf_map &lt;- merge(states_map, df_rank1, by.x = \"region\", by.y = \"State\", all.x = TRUE)\n\n#We plot the map\nggplot(data = df_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = Top10Percent)) +\n    geom_polygon(color = \"black\") +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Top 12%\" = \"#843722\", \"Below Top 12%\" = \"#ffe0bd\"), \n                      labels = c(\"Below Top 12%\", \"Top 12%\")) +\n    labs(fill = \"Category\") +\n    theme_bw() +\n    theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n          axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n          axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank()) +\n    coord_fixed(1.4) +\n    labs(title = \"Top 12% of States by Percent Change in Death Rates due to Alzheimer's\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can clearly see a cluster in the south-east of the U.S. This cluster concentrates the 12% that saw the biggest increase in deaths due to alzhmeier’s (age-adjusted).\nAccording to this study: https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/data-shows-racial-disparities-alzheimers-disease-diagnosis-between-black-and-white-research, black people are almost twice more likely to develop dementia due to a higher exposure to risk factors. For this reason, we will investigate black race distribution by state.\nFirst, let’s take a look if there is indeed a difference between the Age-Adjusted Death Rate of Black vs White people:\n\n\nCode\n#Loading cases of Alzheimer distinguished by race across time: \ncdc_dataset_race = read_csv(\"NCHS_Leading_Causes_of_Death_United_States_2020_Race.csv\")\ncdc_dataset_race &lt;- cdc_dataset_race |&gt; mutate_all(~ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .))\ncdc_usa_race = cdc_dataset_race |&gt; filter(State == \"United States\") |&gt; select(Year, Race, Age_Adj_Death_Rate)\n\n\n#Pivot wider:\ncdc_usa_race &lt;- cdc_usa_race |&gt; pivot_wider(names_from = Race, values_from = Age_Adj_Death_Rate)\ncdc_usa_race &lt;- cdc_usa_race |&gt; mutate(across(-Year, ~ ./first(.) - 1))\n\n#pivot_longer this data:\ncdc_usa_race &lt;- cdc_usa_race |&gt; pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = \"Alzheimer\", values_to = \"Cumulative Change\")\n\n\n#Creating the time series plot\nggplot(cdc_usa_race, aes(x = Year, y = `Cumulative Change`, color = Alzheimer)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.3) +\n  labs(title = \"Cumulative Percentual Change ('99-'20) - Alzheimer - Age Adjusted Death Rate\", x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Cumulative Percentual Change\", color = \"Race\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(), breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 8))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10))\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, we can clearly see a difference between white and black people: the later having increased its death rate by 160% vs 95% during the last 20 years.\nLet’s see then the distribution of black people by state. We will take the averages across the time period:\n\n\nCode\ncdc_usa_race_pop = read_csv(\"NCHS_United_States_2020_Race_Distribution.csv\")\ncdc_usa_race_pop = cdc_usa_race_pop |&gt; group_by(Race, State) |&gt; summarize(Population = mean(Population))\ncdc_usa_race_pop &lt;- cdc_usa_race_pop |&gt; pivot_wider(names_from = Race, values_from = Population)\ncdc_usa_race_pop$Total = cdc_usa_race_pop$Black + cdc_usa_race_pop$White\ncdc_usa_race_pop$Black = cdc_usa_race_pop$Black/cdc_usa_race_pop$Total\ncdc_usa_race_pop = cdc_usa_race_pop |&gt; select(State, Black)\n\n\n#We calculate the 88th percentile (top 12% threshold)\ncdc_usa_race_pop_threshold &lt;- quantile(cdc_usa_race_pop$Black, probs = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n#We create a new variable\ncdc_usa_race_pop$TopPercent &lt;- ifelse(cdc_usa_race_pop$Black &gt; cdc_usa_race_pop_threshold, \"Top 25%\", \"Below Top 25%\")\n\n#For the merge to work, we ensure that state names in both datasets are in lowercase for successful merging\ncdc_usa_race_pop$State &lt;- tolower(cdc_usa_race_pop$State)\nstates_map &lt;- map_data(\"state\")\nstates_map$region &lt;- tolower(states_map$region)\n\n#Merging the datasets\ndf_map &lt;- merge(states_map, cdc_usa_race_pop, by.x = \"region\", by.y = \"State\", all.x = TRUE)\n\n#We plot the map\nggplot(data = df_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = TopPercent)) +\n    geom_polygon(color = \"black\") +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Top 25%\" = \"#843722\", \"Below Top 25%\" = \"#ffe0bd\"), \n                      labels = c(\"Below Top 25%\", \"Top 25%\")) +\n    labs(fill = \"Category\") +\n    theme_bw() +\n    theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n          axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n          axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank()) +\n    coord_fixed(1.4) +\n    labs(title = \"Top 25% of States with more Black People\")\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough not perfect, we see a strong correlation that supports the study: southern states have the most share of black people, and it coincides with the states that have had higher increases of deaths due to Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n\n3.1.6 Analyzing Unintentional Injuries\nThe increase is clearly due to opioids: https://www.cdc.gov/opioids/basics/epidemic.html\nI was trying to get a dataset like: opioid sales.. but ofc, this is illegal market, and hard to record any data… it seems that deaths are the only dataset to track the consumption? Not sure….\n\n\n3.1.7 Analyzing Suicide\nDidnt manage to arrive here today."

Be thoughtful about how you use interactivity and/or animation: using these features to add value in a way that would not be possible with a static graph.\nDesign with the goal of users walking away with a new understanding of the data and a clear understanding of the purpose of the visualization. If the tool is interactive, provide clear instructions on how the user should engage. Thoughtfulness and originality is more important than technical prowess; in all aspects of the project, think quality, not quantity.\nInteractive graphs must follow all of the best practices as with static graphs in terms of perception, labeling, accuracy, etc.\nYour D3/javascript code should be added to a .js file in the scripts/ folder of your repo. I will provide more information on how to do this."
