    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe first aspect of our investigation focuses on identifying the current leading causes of death in the United States. This analysis is very important because it helps us determine which health problems kill the most people. Knowing these causes will help healthcare professionals and policymakers decide where to focus their efforts and resources. We want to show you the biggest health risks Americans have had in the past and still face today by looking at CDC data.\nNext, we will explore how these leading causes have changed over the past decade. This historical perspective is important for noticing trends in public health, like when new health threats appear or when others are successfully lowered. By comparing past and present data, we can gain insights into the effectiveness of healthcare policies and medical advancements and identify areas that still need attention.\nWe will also focus on the geographical and racial disparities in these causes of death. Examining the variation in mortality causes across different states and races uncovers the inequalities in health outcomes. This part of the investigation will highlight areas where certain groups are disproportionately affected, providing a foundation for more equitable health strategies and interventions.\nThis analysis holds significant value for policymakers and health planners. By understanding the current trends and historical changes in mortality causes, decision-makers can better target and develop projects and policies to address these issues. This investigation aims to clarify the general trend in deaths, and where improvement can be done. For this, we will answer the following questions:\n\nWhat are the current leading causes of death in the United States?\nWhat causes seem to be more controlled? Which should be quickly tackled?\nHow have these leading causes changed over the last two decades?\nHow do these causes of death vary across different states and races?\nAre there states that need more urgent investment in health care to control some causes of death?\nIs there any explanation we can offer for the trends visualized?\n\nFinally, we will link deaths for unintentional injuries to the recent opioid problem in the United States. The shocking 645,000 opioid-related deaths that happened from 1999 to 2021 show that the opioid crisis is a dangerous and growing problem that needs to be fixed. There have been two alarming waves in this crisis: a big rise in heroin overdoses starting in 2010 and a rise in deaths related to synthetic opioids, mostly from illegally made fentanyl, starting in 2013. In order to address this situation, having a clear understating is the starting point of any measure taken."

    "section": "2.1 Technical description",
    "text": "2.1 Technical description\n\n2.1.1 Data collection\nWe will work with data related to deaths published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The data is collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), specifically by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). This involves gathering mortality and population data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), which receives information from state and local health departments in the United States.\n\n\n2.1.2 Description of the data\n\nFormat: The data set is publicly available in CSV files on the following website: Link\nFrequency: Annually updated from 1999 to 2020\nFeatures: Key features include causes of death, demographic information (race, sex, age), and geographic location (state).\nDimensions: the data set provides the following metrics:\n\nDeaths: number of deaths that occurred in a specific year for a specific race, sex, or state.\nPopulation: the total population for that specific year, race, state, etc.\nCrude Death Rate: the number of deaths divided by the total population.\nAge-Adjusted Death Rate: number of deaths adjusted by age.\n\nSpecific description: The primary data set has 37290 rows and 8 columns.\n\nIt is important to differentiate between Age-Adjusted Death Rate, Deaths, and Crude Death Rate. While the three provide information about mortality, we will focus on the Age-Adjusted-Death-Rate. The Crude Rate measures the number of deaths in a given population divided by the size of that population.\n\\[\n\\text{Crude Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Deaths}}{\\text{Population}} 100,000\n\\]\nAn increase in the number of deaths will cause a rise in the Crude Death Rate. However, this can be misleading in populations with a growing number of elderly people, who naturally have a higher likelihood of dying.\nOn the other hand, the Age-Adjusted Death Rate is a mortality rate statistically modified to eliminate the effect of different age distributions in different populations. This rate allows comparisons between populations with different age structures. A good explanation of the difference can be found here. As a formula, it can be defined as,\n\\[\n\\text{Age-Adj Death Rate} = \\sum_{i \\in \\text{Age-Groups}} (w_i \\times \\text{CrudeRate}_i)\\times 100,000\n\\]\nThe Age-Adjusted Death Rate is essentially a weighted average of Crude Rates for different age groups. In this metric, each additional death adds \\(w_i\\times1\\) to the total, whereas in the Crude Rate, its contribution is a fixed (and higher) value of \\(1\\). For populations with a significant percentage of individuals aged 85 and above, the number of deaths is adjusted by the group’s weight. This adjustment yields a metric that facilitates the comparison of mortality rates across diverse populations.\n\n\n2.1.3 Importing the Data\nThe data set can be obtained from the CDC website in a CSV format. We will store the data set in the repository and import it into R using the read_csv() function.\n\n\n2.1.4 Data Analysis Limitations and Concerns\nOverall, the data is consistent, and the figures appear accurate, with no inherent discrepancies observed. However, it’s important to note that the CDC refrains from calculating Age-Adjusted Death Rates or Crude Death Rates when the total number of deaths is 10 or fewer, labeling these instances as ‘Unreliable’. While the actual numbers in such cases would be minimal, it’s reasonable to consider these ‘Unreliable’ values as zero for analytical purposes. We will speak more about this in the Missing value analysis section.\nWe can take a look at the first few rows of the data set:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\ncdc_dataset = read_csv(\"NCHS_Leading_Causes_of_Death_United_States_2020.csv\")\nprint(head(cdc_dataset, 10))\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 8\n    Year `113 Cause Name`      `Cause Name` State Deaths Population `Crude Rate`\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  1999 Tuberculosis (A16-A1… Tuberculosis Alab…     16    4430141         NA  \n 2  1999 Septicemia (A40-A41)  Septicemia   Alab…    691    4430141         15.6\n 3  1999 Viral hepatitis (B15… Viral hepat… Alab…     63    4430141          1.4\n 4  1999 Human immunodeficien… Human immun… Alab…    177    4430141          4  \n 5  1999 Malignant neoplasms … Cancer       Alab…   9506    4430141        215. \n 6  1999 In situ neoplasms, b… In situ neo… Alab…    237    4430141          5.3\n 7  1999 Anemias (D50-D64)     Anemias      Alab…    110    4430141          2.5\n 8  1999 Diabetes mellitus (E… Diabetes     Alab…   1341    4430141         30.3\n 9  1999 Nutritional deficien… Nutritional… Alab…     85    4430141          1.9\n10  1999 Meningitis (G00,G03)  Meningitis   Alab…     11    4430141         NA  \n# ℹ 1 more variable: `Age Adjusted Rate` &lt;dbl&gt;"

First, we will distinguish what causes of death seem to be controlled against those growing in recent years. This will require us to compare time series and choose adequate metrics for comparison appropriately.\nWe will continue by going deeper into those causes that have been growing, and we will offer explanations for the shape or their trends. This will help policymakers have a clear understanding of the reasons behind the spikes in deaths and, ergo, offer adequate measures to control them.\nFinally, we will explore the causes of death on a state-by-state and race basis. This will uncover states with disproportionately high death rates from specific causes, highlighting regions where healthcare investment may be urgently needed"

    "section": "2.3 Missing value analysis",
    "text": "2.3 Missing value analysis\nAccording to the CDC: “Statistics representing fewer than ten persons (0-9) are suppressed. Rates are marked as “unreliable” when the death count is less than 20.” The reason is to protect individual privacy and confidentiality. This ensures that data cannot be used to identify or infer information about specific individuals, maintaining ethical standards in data handling and reporting.\nFor this reason, our data set contains N/A values in Age Adjusted Death Rate and Crude Rate for deaths lower than 20. Moreover, there are no entries having deaths less than 10. We can confirm this by looking at the summary() of the column Deaths being 10:\n\n\nCode\n#Searching for the minimum value registered for Deaths\nsummary(cdc_dataset$Deaths)\n\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n     10      50     203    2618     866  725192 \n\n\nThis then confirms that the dataset consists of entries having Deaths higher or equal than 10.\nFinally, we can see the distribution of Deaths for N/A’s. The values should be higher than 10, and less or equal than 20. Otherwise there are inconsistencies:\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary library\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\n\nCode\nfiltered_data &lt;- subset(cdc_dataset, is.na(`Age Adjusted Rate`))\nmax_death &lt;- max(filtered_data$Deaths, na.rm = TRUE)\n\nggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = Deaths)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, boundary = 9, fill = \"turquoise\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 9:max_death + 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Deaths where Age Adjusted Death Rate is NA\", x = \"Deaths\", y = \"Frequency\")+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the minimum value is 10 and the maximum is 19. This means that all NAs have values lower than 20 as the CDC stated.\n\n\nCode\n#Libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n#Subset\nna_count &lt;- cdc_dataset %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Cause Name`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(NA_Count = sum(is.na(`Age Adjusted Rate`))) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(NA_Count))\n\n#plot\nggplot(na_count, aes(x = NA_Count, y = reorder(`Cause Name`, NA_Count))) +\n geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"lightblue\", color = 'black') +\n  labs(title = \"Count of NAs in Age Adjusted Rate by Cause\", x = \"Number of NAs\", y = \"Cause Name\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nWe suspect that Meningitis, Infections of kidney, Pneumoconioses, Legal intervention and Hyperplasia are the causes with more NA’s given the inherent lower probability of dying because of these causes. If that’s the case, we might safely treat NA’s Age-Adjusted Death Rate and Crude Rates as zero, as in the worst case, they are very small numbers. We analyze the median of Age Adjusted Death Rate across the whole period (1999-2020):\n\n\nCode\nmedian_data &lt;- cdc_dataset %&gt;%\n  filter(`Cause Name` %in% c(\"Meningitis\", \"Infections of kidney\", \n                             \"Pneumoconioses and chemical effects\", \n                             \"Legal intervention\", \"Hyperplasia of prostate\") & !is.na(`Age Adjusted Rate`)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Cause Name`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Median = median(`Crude Rate`))\n\n#Plotting bars:\nggplot(median_data, aes(x = reorder(`Cause Name`, -Median), y = Median)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"#9c6e54\", color = 'black') +\n  labs(title = \"Median of Crude Rate for Selected Causes\", x = \"Cause Name\", y = \"Median Crude Rate\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, we can see that Infections of kidney has the biggest magnitude and it is only a Crude Rate of 0.3. This means that the median value of deaths caused by Infections of kidney in the United States, is just 0.3 persons per 100,000 people. Or 3 in 1 million."

We would like to understand the interplay between population growth, deaths growth, and the evolution of death rates since 1999. For this, we will create metrics and facet them in time series.\n\n\nCode\n#Grouping by Year and State, and summarizing the data. We can take min(Population) to keep the population of that year\ncdc_usa_grouped &lt;- cdc_usa |&gt; group_by(Year) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    Deaths = sum(Deaths),\n    Population = min(Population),\n    Crude_Rate = sum(Crude_Rate),\n    Age_Adj_Rate = sum(Age_Adj_Rate),\n    .groups = 'drop'\n  )\n\n\n#Reshaping data using pivot_longer so we can facet by metric:\ncdc_usa_long &lt;- cdc_usa_grouped |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(Deaths, Population, Crude_Rate, Age_Adj_Rate), names_to = \"Metric\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\n#Adjusting the order and names of the metrics\ncdc_usa_long$Metric &lt;- factor(cdc_usa_long$Metric, \n                                      levels = c(\"Population\", \"Crude_Rate\", \"Deaths\", \"Age_Adj_Rate\"),\n                                      labels = c(\"Population in US\", \"Crude Death Rate\", \"Deaths\", \"Age Adjusted Death Rate\"))\n\n#Creating the time series:\nggplot(cdc_usa_long, aes(x = Year, y = Value)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#FF6C22\", size = 1.2) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Metric, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 2) +\n  labs(title = \"Time Series\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Value\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma, breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 4)) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s make some general observations:\n\nPopulation went from 280 millions in 1999 to 330 in 2020. This is an approximate growth of 18%.\nIn the same period, death increased by 16%, which is less than population growth.\nThe Crude Death Rate, which is simply the number of deaths divided by the total population reflects this fact going down to 665 from 680. This means that the death rate went down 2.2%.\nHowever, and more surprising, age adjusted death rate reduced 29%.\n\nA good way to compare the trends, would be to observe the cumulative perceptual growth of each metric, in a single time series plot:\n\n\nCode\n#Calculating cumulative percentual change for each column\ncdc_usa_grouped_cum &lt;- cdc_usa_grouped |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Deaths = Deaths / first(Deaths) - 1,\n    Population = Population / first(Population) - 1,\n    Crude_Rate = Crude_Rate / first(Crude_Rate) - 1,\n    Age_Adj_Rate = Age_Adj_Rate / first(Age_Adj_Rate) - 1\n  )\n\n#pivot_longer this data:\ncdc_usa_grouped_cum &lt;- cdc_usa_grouped_cum |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = \"Metric\", values_to = \"Cumulative Change\")\n\n\n#Creating the time series plot\nggplot(cdc_usa_grouped_cum, aes(x = Year, y = `Cumulative Change`, color = Metric)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.3) +\n  labs(title = \"Cumulative Percentual Change (1999-2020)\", x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Cumulative Percentual Change\", color = \"Metric\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(), breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 8))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10))\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral observations:\n\nAs stated before, population growth has been steady in the period.\nBetween 1999 and 2012, Total Deaths were approximately constant while the population grew steadily. This provoked the Crude Rate to decrease sharply (denominator increasing). However, from 2013 to 2020, we observed a sharp increase in Deaths, growing around 10% in 7 years. Interestingly, 6% was given from 2013 to 2019 and 4% in 2020. The issue is that COVID-19 exacerbated the severity of other diseases, causing more deaths, which were categorized not as COVID-19 directly. Remember that in this dataset, we omit COVID-19, but we, in fact, see an effect from the pandemic, which is seen in the spikes of 2020.\nAlthough population growth lost some steam from 2013 to 2020, the real cause of the increase in the crude rate of deaths is a sharp increase in deaths.\nWhile the crude rate increased considerably during the period, the age-adjusted death rate kept decreasing. This metric takes into consideration the age distribution of people. If deaths increase because people are aging, it assigns a lesser weight to the metric by weighting by age buckets. This means the metric can be compared across populations with different age structures. Overall, we can say that the increase in deaths has been primarily due to an aging population.\nWe can observe how the population has aged by observing the Population Pyramids for the United States in the image below. The U.S. Census Bureau created the Pyramid Population charts that show how the US has aged in the last two decades.\nWe say in aggregate because we will break down by cause and see if we can confirm this intuition.\nFinally, the relatively milder uptick in the Age-Adjusted-Death-Rate in 2020 versus the Crude Rate can be interpreted as COVID causing more deaths in elderly people. The last went up 3.5% that year, while the former was 4.5%.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Understanding the underlying causes of death\nAccording to the CDC, the best metric to study death evolution is using age-adjusted death rates. We then begin by investigating the evolution of age adjusted death rate across time.\n\n\nCode\n#Creating a faceting chart, which will have age adjusted death rates by cause of death:\ndf_usa_cause &lt;- cdc_usa |&gt; select(Year, Cause, Age_Adj_Rate)\nggplot(df_usa_cause, aes(x = Year, y = Age_Adj_Rate, group = Cause, color = Cause)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.5) + # Thicker lines\n  facet_wrap(~ Cause, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(title = \"Time Series of Causes of Death in the USA\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Age Adjusted Death Rate\")+ \n  guides(color = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can make the following observations:\n\nAs seen before, the overall age adjusted death rate in the United States is in aggregate decreasing since 1999\nHowever, not all causes share the same decreasing shape. For instance, Alzheimer’s, Unintentional injuries and suicide, have been increasing dramatically.\nOverall, Cancer, CLRD (Chronic lower respiratory diseases), Heart diseases, Kidney diseases and Strokes have shown an impressive reduction in deaths.\nDiabetes seems to be a cause for concern, but it can be explained by COVID-19: “Several underlying medical conditions can increase the risk of severe illness and a higher likelihood of lethality if a person contracts COVID-19, including diabetes”.\n\nThe different types of causes don’t share the same dimensions. We can compare the evolution of these death-rates calculating the percentual growth over time:\n\n\nCode\ncdc_usa_wider &lt;- df_usa_cause |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(\n    id_cols = Year,\n    names_from = Cause,\n    values_from = Age_Adj_Rate\n  )\n\n#Calculating cumulative percentual change for each column\ncdc_usa_wider &lt;- cdc_usa_wider |&gt; mutate(across(-Year, ~ ./first(.) - 1))\n\n\n#pivot_longer this data:\ncdc_usa_wider &lt;- cdc_usa_wider |&gt; pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = \"Metric\", values_to = \"Cumulative Change\")\n\n#We use a color blind friendly palette\ncolor_blind_friendly &lt;- c(\"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\", \n                          \"#0072B2\", \"#D55E00\", \"#CC79A7\", \"#999999\", \n                          \"#882255\", \"#88CCEE\")\n\n#Creating the time series plot\nggplot(cdc_usa_wider, aes(x = Year, y = `Cumulative Change`, color = Metric)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.3) +\n  labs(title = \"Cumulative Change - Age Adj. Deaht Rate\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Cumulative Percentual Change\", color = \"Metric\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(), breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 8))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = color_blind_friendly)\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the cumulative percentage time series graph broken down by cause, we can see some interesting trends and better understand the trends over time. In particular, deaths caused by Alzheimer’s disease is aggressively increasing year by year. Unintentional injuries and suicide are the number two and number three fastest growing causes of death, respectively. Additionally, we can note that stroke, influenza and pneumonia, and heart disease have actually been decreasing during the same time of 1999-2020. Those we should note that death from Stroke, Influenza and pneumonia, and heart disease diseases showed a decreasing trend until 2012, but then began to grow again.\nThe overall trend is downward for the age adjusted death rate. However, we have identified three causes that show a different behavior. Now we will try to identify which states are leading in these metrics.\n\n\n3.1.4 Disaggregating by state\n\n\nCode\n#Filter the data for the specified conditions\ndf_rank1 &lt;- cdc_dataset |&gt; filter(State != 'United States') |&gt;\n  select(Year, State, Cause, Age_Adj_Rate)|&gt; \n  filter(Year %in% c(1999, 2020), Cause == \"Alzheimer's disease\")\n\n# Calculating the percentual difference change from 2000 to 2017 for each state\ndf_rank1 &lt;- df_rank1 %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = Age_Adj_Rate) |&gt;\n  mutate(PercentChange = `2020`/`1999`-1) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(PercentChange))\n\n\n#Cleveland\nggplot(df_rank1, aes(x = PercentChange, y = reorder(State, PercentChange))) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, color = \"darkgreen\") +\n  labs(title = \"Alzheimer's Disiease %Chg. in Age Adj. Death Rate\", x = \"Percentage Change 1999 to 2020\", y = 'State') +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(colour = \"grey60\", linetype = \"dashed\"))+\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(), breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 8))+\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that Mississippi, Arkansas and Alabama have seen the largest increase, while Maine, Maryland and Montana are the smallest.\n\n\nCode\n#Filter the data for the specified conditions\ndf_rank2 &lt;- cdc_dataset |&gt; filter(State != 'United States') |&gt;\n  select(Year, State, Cause, Age_Adj_Rate)|&gt; \n  filter(Year %in% c(1999, 2020), Cause == \"Unintentional injuries\")\n\n# Calculating the percentual difference change from 2000 to 2017 for each state\ndf_rank2 &lt;- df_rank2 %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = Age_Adj_Rate) |&gt;\n  mutate(PercentChange = `2020`/`1999`-1) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(PercentChange))\n\n\n#Cleveland\nggplot(df_rank2, aes(x = PercentChange, y = reorder(State, PercentChange))) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, color = \"darkblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Unintentional Injuries %Chg. in Age Adj. Death Rate\", x = \"Percentage Change 1999 to 2020\", y = 'State') +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(colour = \"grey60\", linetype = \"dashed\"))+\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(), breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 8))+\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Massachusetts have seen the largest increase, while Idaho, Nebraska and Alabama are the smallest.\n\n\nCode\n#Filter the data for the specified conditions\ndf_rank3 &lt;- cdc_dataset |&gt; filter(State != 'United States') |&gt;\n  select(Year, State, Cause, Age_Adj_Rate)|&gt; \n  filter(Year %in% c(1999, 2020), Cause == \"Suicide\")\n\n# Calculating the percentual difference change from 2000 to 2017 for each state\ndf_rank3 &lt;- df_rank3 %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Year, values_from = Age_Adj_Rate) |&gt;\n  mutate(PercentChange = `2020`/`1999`-1) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(PercentChange))\n\n\n#Cleveland\nggplot(df_rank3, aes(x = PercentChange, y = reorder(State, PercentChange))) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, color = \"orange\") +\n  labs(title = \"Suicide %Chg. in Age Adj. Death Rate\", x = \"Percentage Change 1999 to 2020\", y = 'State') +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(colour = \"grey60\", linetype = \"dashed\"))+\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(), breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 8))+\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that Utah, Idaho and North Dakota have seen the largest increase, while Delaware, Rhode Island and Louisiana the smallest.\nIt is interesting to note that in the case of Alzheimer’s, Unintentional Injuries and Suicide, the three diseases exhibit increasing age adjusted rates in the period. There are only a few exceptions such as Nevada and Rhode Island in Suicide or Maine in Alzheimer’s where a decreasing rate has been seen. For this reason, we believe it is worth looking at box plots to identify outliers and find explanations for them.\n\n\nCode\ndf_box &lt;- rbind(\n  df_rank1[, c(\"State\", \"Cause\", \"PercentChange\")],\n  df_rank2[, c(\"State\", \"Cause\", \"PercentChange\")],\n  df_rank3[, c(\"State\", \"Cause\", \"PercentChange\")]\n)\n\nggplot(df_box, aes(x = Cause, y = PercentChange)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"#A6CF98\", color = \"black\") + \n  theme_bw() + labs(title = \"Box-Plot: Percent Change by Cause - 1999 to 2020 - by States\", x = \"Cause\", y = \"Percent Change\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\n\n\n\n\n\nMatching these values with the previous cleveland dop plots, we can say that Missisipi is an outlier for Alzheimer. Rhode Island and West Virginia are outliers for Unintentional Injuries. Finally, Suicide seems to not have any outlier. From the boxplots we also notice that the three causes are skewed to the right.\n\n\n3.1.5 Analyzing Alzheimer’s Disease\nApparently the states most affected by Alzheimer’s are in the southern part of the United States. Given the possible geographical dependence, we propose to corroborate the information with the following geospatial visualization.\nTo make the differences more notorious, we are going to paint the top 12% of States in terms growing deaths due to Alzheimer.\n\n\nCode\n#We calculate the 88th percentile (top 12% threshold)\ntop_10_percent_threshold &lt;- quantile(df_rank1$PercentChange, probs = 0.88, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n#We create a new variable to indicate top 12%\ndf_rank1$Top10Percent &lt;- ifelse(df_rank1$PercentChange &gt; top_10_percent_threshold, \"Top 12%\", \"Below Top 12%\")\n\n#For the merge to work, we ensure that state names in both datasets are in lowercase for successful merging\ndf_rank1$State &lt;- tolower(df_rank1$State)\nstates_map &lt;- map_data(\"state\")\nstates_map$region &lt;- tolower(states_map$region)\n\n#Merging the datasets\ndf_map &lt;- merge(states_map, df_rank1, by.x = \"region\", by.y = \"State\", all.x = TRUE)\n\n#We plot the map\nggplot(data = df_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = Top10Percent)) +\n    geom_polygon(color = \"black\") +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Top 12%\" = \"#843722\", \"Below Top 12%\" = \"#ffe0bd\"), \n                      labels = c(\"Below Top 12%\", \"Top 12%\")) +\n    labs(fill = \"Category\") +\n    theme_bw() +\n    theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n          axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n          axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank()) +\n    coord_fixed(1.4) +\n    labs(title = \"Top 12% of States by Percent Change in Death Rates due to Alzheimer's\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can clearly see a cluster in the south-east of the U.S. This cluster concentrates the 12% that saw the biggest increase in deaths due to alzhmeier’s (age-adjusted).\nAccording to this study: https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/data-shows-racial-disparities-alzheimers-disease-diagnosis-between-black-and-white-research, black people are almost twice more likely to develop dementia due to a higher exposure to risk factors. For this reason, we will investigate black race distribution by state.\nFirst, let’s take a look if there is indeed a difference between the Age-Adjusted Death Rate of Black vs White people:\n\n\nCode\n#Loading cases of Alzheimer distinguished by race across time: \ncdc_dataset_race = read_csv(\"NCHS_Leading_Causes_of_Death_United_States_2020_Race.csv\")\ncdc_dataset_race &lt;- cdc_dataset_race |&gt; mutate_all(~ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .))\ncdc_usa_race = cdc_dataset_race |&gt; filter(State == \"United States\") |&gt; select(Year, Race, Age_Adj_Death_Rate)\n\n\n#Pivot wider:\ncdc_usa_race &lt;- cdc_usa_race |&gt; pivot_wider(names_from = Race, values_from = Age_Adj_Death_Rate)\ncdc_usa_race &lt;- cdc_usa_race |&gt; mutate(across(-Year, ~ ./first(.) - 1))\n\n#pivot_longer this data:\ncdc_usa_race &lt;- cdc_usa_race |&gt; pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = \"Alzheimer\", values_to = \"Cumulative Change\")\n\n\n#Creating the time series plot\nggplot(cdc_usa_race, aes(x = Year, y = `Cumulative Change`, color = Alzheimer)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.3) +\n  labs(title = \"Cumulative Percentual Change ('99-'20) - Alzheimer - Age Adjusted Death Rate\", x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Cumulative Percentual Change\", color = \"Race\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(), breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 8))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10))\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, we can clearly see a difference between white and black people: the later having increased its death rate by 160% vs 95% during the last 20 years.\nLet’s see then the distribution of black people by state. We will take the averages across the time period:\n\n\nCode\ncdc_usa_race_pop = read_csv(\"NCHS_United_States_2020_Race_Distribution.csv\")\ncdc_usa_race_pop = cdc_usa_race_pop |&gt; group_by(Race, State) |&gt; summarize(Population = mean(Population))\ncdc_usa_race_pop &lt;- cdc_usa_race_pop |&gt; pivot_wider(names_from = Race, values_from = Population)\ncdc_usa_race_pop$Total = cdc_usa_race_pop$Black + cdc_usa_race_pop$White\ncdc_usa_race_pop$Black = cdc_usa_race_pop$Black/cdc_usa_race_pop$Total\ncdc_usa_race_pop = cdc_usa_race_pop |&gt; select(State, Black)\n\n\n#We calculate the 88th percentile (top 12% threshold)\ncdc_usa_race_pop_threshold &lt;- quantile(cdc_usa_race_pop$Black, probs = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n#We create a new variable\ncdc_usa_race_pop$TopPercent &lt;- ifelse(cdc_usa_race_pop$Black &gt; cdc_usa_race_pop_threshold, \"Top 25%\", \"Below Top 25%\")\n\n#For the merge to work, we ensure that state names in both datasets are in lowercase for successful merging\ncdc_usa_race_pop$State &lt;- tolower(cdc_usa_race_pop$State)\nstates_map &lt;- map_data(\"state\")\nstates_map$region &lt;- tolower(states_map$region)\n\n#Merging the datasets\ndf_map &lt;- merge(states_map, cdc_usa_race_pop, by.x = \"region\", by.y = \"State\", all.x = TRUE)\n\n#We plot the map\nggplot(data = df_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = TopPercent)) +\n    geom_polygon(color = \"black\") +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Top 25%\" = \"#843722\", \"Below Top 25%\" = \"#ffe0bd\"), \n                      labels = c(\"Below Top 25%\", \"Top 25%\")) +\n    labs(fill = \"Category\") +\n    theme_bw() +\n    theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n          axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n          axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank()) +\n    coord_fixed(1.4) +\n    labs(title = \"Top 25% of States with more Black People\")\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough not perfect, we see a strong correlation that supports the study: southern states have the most share of black people, and it coincides with the states that have had higher increases of deaths due to Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n\n3.1.6 Analyzing Unintentional Injuries\nThe increase is clearly due to opioids: https://www.cdc.gov/opioids/basics/epidemic.html\nI was trying to get a dataset like: opioid sales.. but ofc, this is illegal market, and hard to record any data… it seems that deaths are the only dataset to track the consumption? Not sure….\n\n\n3.1.7 Analyzing Suicide\nDidnt manage to arrive here today."
